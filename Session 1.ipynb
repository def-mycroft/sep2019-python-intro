    "But why specifically Python? There are too many different programming languages out there to list, why not learn C, C#, C++, R, Scala, Ruby, Java, Javascript or Julia? \n",
    "\n",
    "Here is what I view as the case for Python specifically: \n",
    "\n",
    ">**Programming languages highly commoditized**. They're all fundamentally the same thing: variables, loops, conditionals and data containers. Once you learn one language, the others come more easily. \n",
    "\n",
    ">**Python is a good first language, easier to learn**. It is relatively simple (e.g. inferred typing), and Python is very, very well organized and well documented.\n",
    "\n",
    ">**Python has an engaged and supportive community**. Python has been one of the most popular programming languages for several years now, as measured by surveys and other analysis. There are 1.2M+ Python threads on stackoverflow. There are pages and pages of results for a Google query \"learn python\". A lot of programmers really love Python and want to spread and support the language. \n",
    "\n",
    ">**Python has a great depth of add-ons, esp scientific/statistical**. There are too many add-ons to list. With Python you have `numpy`, `scipy`, `pandas`, `sklearn` for data analysis and modeling. APIs are increasingly implemented in Python, and oftentimes someone in the open-source community has written a Python wrapper around the API that you want to use. \n",
    "\n",
    ">**The supposed downsides of Python don't matter very much for our purposes**. Python is objectively slower than the C family or Javascript, but development speed is usually more important than execution speed, and in many cases Python is wrapped around faster code like C (e.g. in `pandas`) or Fortran (e.g. in `numpy`). The job market for Python programmers is smaller than that for other programmers, but we're not trying to get a job as Python programmers."
